EmoHomeControl
==============

An example of interfacing between an Emotiv EEG headset and Razberry Z-Way API for home automation on the Raspberry Pi.

Parts of this code are taken from Emotiv's EmoStateLog Java example script.  This also includes the Apache Software Foundation's HttpClient library under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

The Emotiv SDK libraries required to interface with the headset are not included in this project.  Access to these libraries can be acquired by purchasing and SDK License from them.

I have put together a [demonstration of this script and set up on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQPvDVrb6xc).  You can also find more details about the project on [my blog](http://blog.dailyinvention.com/controlling-home-lighting-with-your-mind-2/).
